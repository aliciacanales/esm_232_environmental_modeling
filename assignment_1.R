# a. Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation.  You can use the following formula: 
#   
#   $E = A * r * H * PR$
#     
#     * E is energy (kWh),
#   * A is the solar panel area (m2)
#   * r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
#   * PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
#   * H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)
#   
#   
#   b. Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canva.
